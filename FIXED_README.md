# Forex Feedback Engine - Fixed Version

This document outlines the fixes made to the Forex Feedback Engine to resolve issues with the temporal context decision engine.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Timestamp Issue with Polygon API**
   - Fixed timestamp handling in `historical_feed.py` to use proper date formats expected by Polygon API
   - Ensured start/end dates are properly formatted and not in the future

2. **OpenAI API Authentication and Compatibility**
   - Updated client initialization to properly handle both v0.x and v1.x OpenAI APIs
   - Removed dependency on `pkg_resources` for version detection
   - Improved error handling for API calls

3. **Empty Historical Data Handling**
   - Added robust error handling for empty DataFrames in all methods
   - Added fallback to simulated data when real data is unavailable
   - Prevented KeyError exceptions when accessing DataFrame columns

4. **Weekend Trading Support with Cryptocurrency**
   - Added support for cryptocurrency symbols (BTCUSD, ETHUSD, etc.) that trade 24/7
   - Implemented smart detection of symbol types (forex vs crypto)
   - Added proper formatting for Polygon API tickers (C: for forex, X: for crypto)
   - Automatically prioritizes crypto symbols on weekends
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing forex symbol handling

## Testing the Fixes

Verification scripts have been created to test that all fixes work correctly:

```powershell
# Set required environment variables
$env:POLYGON_API_KEY="your_polygon_api_key"
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"

# Run the general verification script
python verify_fixes.py

# Run the cryptocurrency support validation script
python validate_crypto_symbols.py
```

The verification scripts will test:

1. Historical data collection with Polygon API (both forex and crypto)
2. OpenAI API authentication and version handling
3. Error handling for empty datasets
4. Symbol type detection and formatting
5. Weekend data availability with cryptocurrencies

## Running the System

To run the trading system with the fixes:

```powershell
# Set required environment variables
$env:POLYGON_API_KEY="your_polygon_api_key"
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
$env:PO_SSID="your_pocket_option_ssid"

# Run the main application
python -m src.main
```

## Next Steps

With these fixes in place, the following enhancements can now be implemented:

1. Multi-timeframe analysis (combining different timeframes for more robust signals)
2. Decision memory module (learning from past trades)
3. Backtesting framework (testing against historical data)
4. Performance metrics (more detailed analytics)
5. User interface improvements (better visualization and control)
